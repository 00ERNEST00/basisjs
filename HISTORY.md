- API: new helpers `basis.data.wrap`, `basis.data.wrapObject` and `basis.data.wrapData`
- API: using of `basis.data` as a function is deprecated now (use `basis.data.wrap` instead)
- API: add warning when using deprecated `basis.dom.event.onLoad` (`basis.ready` must be use instead)
- API: using of `basis.dom.event` as a function is deprecated now (use `basis.dom.event.wrap` instead)
- API: using of `basis.ui.field` as a function is deprecated now (use `basis.ui.field.create` instead)
- API: `basis.ui.Table#loadData` method was removed
- FIX: building of search index in docs
- FIX: exception on function to string convertation in docs (for functions with overloaded `toString` method)
- NEW: `basis.ui.PageSlider` is support for page rotation now
- FIX: double add handler in `basis.data.AbstractData#setSyncAction`
- NEW: `basis.net.action.create` creates instance of `basis.net.Transport` by default if `transport`, `service` and `createTrasport` properties is not defined in config
- FIX: `basis.template.Theme#define` become context free
- NEW: `basis.template.TemplateSwitcher` class and `basis.template.switcher` helper was inplemeted, to simplify template switch according to some rule
- NEW: `basis.dom.wrapper.AbstractNode` sync was tweaked to simplify synchronization by node with no additional models or datasets
- API: `basis.data.property` was transform into `basis.data.value`  (`basis.net.rpc` is still available until 0.10.0)
- API: `basis.data.DataObjectSet` was renamed to `basis.data.ObjectSet` (`basis.data.DataObjectSet` is still available as alias)
- API: new class `basis.data.value.BindValue` (it is `basis.data.value.Property` class but with extend constructor), `basis.data.value.Property` inherits it
- API: `basis.data.value.BindValue#addLink` and `basis.data.value.BindValue#removeLink` requires explicit value for second argument ([backward path](https://gist.github.com/lahmatiy/5962364))

- FIX: resolving dictionary pathes in `basis.devpanel` was fixed
- NEW: `basis.entity.Entity` accepts array as value for field type, in this case field become an enum
- NEW: `basis.entity.Entity` accepts string as value for field type (type with that name may not be defined at that moment, when type defines it's wrapper will be set to that field)
- NEW: `basis.entity.EntitySet` accepts string as wrapper (type with that name may not be defined at that moment, when type defines it's wrapper will be set as wrapper for `EntitySet`)
- NEW: `basis.entity.EntitySet` can be named now (second argument for `basis.entity.EntitySet` constructor or first argument for `basis.entity.createSetType` function)
- NEW: new function `basis.entity.validate` add warnings to console if some types was used in `Entity`/`EntitySet` definition but not defined
- FIX: `basis.ui.ScrollTable` crash when table has no footer
- NEW: new property `basis.ui.ScrollTable#fitToContainer`

# 0.9.4 (july 2, 2013)

- NEW: `basis.event.events.*` functions have verbose name in dev mode now (was `anonymous function` before)
- API: `basis.data.property.DataObjectSet` reset `value`/`state` changed flags before set/compute new `value`/`state`, it makes possible trigger recalc `value`/`state` inside event callbacks
- API: `basis.net.rpc` actions handle `abort` event and turn `origin` into `UNDEFINED` state
- API: `basis.net.rpc.callback` was removed ([backward patch](https://gist.github.com/lahmatiy/5891561))
- API: `basis.net.AbstractRequest` don't emit `failure` event and turn request object into `UNDEFINED` state (it's settable via `AbstractRequest#stateOnAbort`) on `abort` ([backward patch](https://gist.github.com/lahmatiy/5891591))
- FIX: add new syntax for `sourceURL` (avoid warnings in Chrome Canary)
- API: `basis.data.property.AbstractData` moved to `basis.data.Value`
- API: `basis.data.Value#updateCount` was removed ([backward patch](https://gist.github.com/lahmatiy/5895614))
- API: `forceEvent` argument for `basis.data.Value#set` was removed ([backward patch](https://gist.github.com/lahmatiy/5895982))
- API: `basis.data.property.AbstractData` and `basis.data.DataObject` aliases are removed
- FIX: `basis.template.makeDeclaration` left html tokens as is when token not resolved
- FIX: double `groupingChanged` event emit was fixed ([issue #8](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs/issues/8))
- FIX: dataset indexes become more stable for incorrect values (avoid `NaN` as value)
- NEW: new class `basis.data.property.Expression` implemented (how to use it see [Data indexes](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs/blob/master/demo/defile/data_index.html) or [TodoMVC](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs/tree/master/demo/apps/todomvc/basis/js) demos)
- NEW: `basis.router` debug info output is optional now (set `basis.router.debug` = `true`/`false` to turn on/off debug output)
- NEW: `basis.resource('..').ready` method implemented, useful for async callback on init attach
