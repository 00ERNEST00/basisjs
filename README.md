NOTE: Documentation and more are coming soon. But you could take a look for some demos on temporary hosting:

* [demos](http://jsclub.ru/basisjs/demo) - some demos (you could clone repo and open path/to/repo_clone/demo/index.html on your own web server)
* [docs](http://jsclub.ru/basisjs/docs) - auto documentation based on framework object structure and jsdocs in javascript files
